# The Pomodoro
Free Code Camp Advanced Project.
This project was not as difficult as the last one. However, it was indeed really challenging.
It has taken me a total of nearly two weeks to complete this project as initially I've written it using jQuery and later refactored to ES6.

The takeway knowledge from this project is the setInterval and clearInterval methods - which will be useful for future projects. 

Shout out to my mentor, Tony Johnson, who has provided guidance with the logic and Data Structure.
